# Book Shelf (Book Management System) in Java

This project is the final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course.
## Project Description
The **Book Management System** is a Java-based application that implements **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to manage book data. This system allows users to add, view, edit, and delete books in the system. The project aims to demonstrate the application of key OOP concepts such as **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism** in software development.

## Project Objectives
- To implement **OOP principles** in managing book data.
- To use the **repository pattern** for modular data management.
- To implement a **service layer** to separate business logic from data access.
- To provide **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for book entities.

1. **Add New Books**  
   Allows the user to add books with details such as title, author, publisher, and year of publication.

2. **View Book List**  
   Displays a list of all books stored in the system, including books in archives.

3. **Edit Book Information**  
   Allows the user to modify the details of an existing book based on ID or other attributes.

4. **Delete Books**  
   Deletes a book from the system based on ID or other attributes.

5. **Archive Books**  
   Allows users to archive books they no longer wish to see in the main list but wish to keep in the system.

6. **View Archived and Non-Archived Books**  
   Users can view the list of archived books separately from the active books list.

7. **Mark Books as Favorite**  
   Users can mark books as favorite for easier reference and categorization.

8. **Track Reading Progress**  
   Users can mark books as "Read" once they finish reading them.

9. **Change Application Theme**  
   Allows users to switch between different themes (e.g., light or dark mode) to customize the user experience.
